                    <h5>Web Developer</h5>
                    <p>I have a bachelors in business from the university of hull, I am married with 4 , this has earned me the nickname King of boys and Khaleesi, Mother of Dragons!  
                            <br>
                            I started my coding journey in 2021 but one could also say i incubated this for most of my life. 
                            I had always been interested in IT ever since my father bought that microsoft desktop that whistled everytime we tried to connect to the internet, i just knew IT was in my future.
                            <br>
                            Same way i just know that i will be a professional Web Dev...by the end of this coveted program.</p>
